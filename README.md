# cohort-19-day3
This repository has tasks for day 3 of Andela cohort 19 bootcamp.

## Word count lab
The word count lab takes in a sentence and splits it into words. 
The lab then returns a dictionary with each a word as key and the number of times the word 
appears in the sentence as its value.

## Max Min number lab
This lab takes in an array of numbers as an argument and returns another array with the maximum and minimum number respectively.
If the maximum number is equal to the minimum number, the count of the numbers given as argument is returned.
